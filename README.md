### Features Left to Implement

- Create a Hamburger menu to improve readability on small screen devices.
- Health Blog: Incorporate a health blog on the website to provide valuable information, tips, and articles on various health topics, promoting education and engagement with visitors.

### Accessibility

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

* Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
* Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
* Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.
* Making menus accessible by indicating the current page as "current" for screen readers, aiding navigation and orientation.

By implementing these considerations, I have strived to enhance the overall accessibility of the website.

Visual Studio Code - Initially, I began drafting my project using VS Code, version 1.79.0, as I encountered technical issues with Codeanywhere, which had an initialization bug.

Codeanywhere - I used Codeanywhere as my official Code Editor for the project. On June 10th 2023, I encountered an issue where I had exceeded my usage hours and my subscription had expired. To resolve this, I reached out to the tutor support, and Sarah kindly provided me with an invitation link. Fortunately, since I had already pushed my commits, the transition to Code Institute's team went smoothly.

## Testing and Solved Bugs

Testing was conducted consistently throughout the website development process to ensure its functionality. Chrome developer tools were utilized to identify and troubleshoot any issues that arose during the build.

During the mid-project meeting with my mentor, we discussed and addressed specific issues that were identified:

- The responsive design of the landing page image for small screen sizes (650px wide and below) had an issue where the right border of the cover text would disappear from the screen. However, this problem was successfully resolved after my mentor suggested including a percentage-based property (1%) for the class "cover-text" and it worked perfectly.
- The testimonials section had an issue with its responsive design, where the image and text were overlapping in medium-sized screens. Initially, I had configured the code using the "float: left" property. However, my mentor suggested changing the CSS approach by using the "display: grid" property. Initially, the grid had four columns, but for medium-sized screens, it was changed to two columns, and for small-sized screens, it was changed to one column. This adjustment resolved the issue, and the responsive design now functions perfectly.
- The responsive design of the welcome section needed improvement as the welcome image was becoming smaller, and the text and image were positioned side by side in small screen sizes. To address this issue, I made the following changes: Replaced the initial code, which used "display: flex," with "display: grid" to achieve better results. Then, I modified the code by setting "grid-template-columns: 1fr" for screen sizes ranging from 900px wide and below. These adjustments were successful in achieving the desired outcome, improving the responsive design of the welcome section.
- A similar issue was promptly resolved in the "Our Team" images by changing the initial code from "display: flex" to "display: grid." This simple modification allowed me to configure the images initially with 4 columns and adjust them to 2 columns for larger to medium screen sizes in the responsive design. Additionally, for small screen sizes, the images were adjusted to display in a single column. This modification successfully addressed the issue and improved the responsive design of the "Our Team" section.
- To enhance the responsiveness of the "Our Services" section on the services page, I made the following changes: Instead of using "display: flex" with a flex-basis of 30% for the IDs "complete-checkup," "clinical-investigations," and "exams," I switched to "display: grid" with three template columns initially set as "1fr 1fr 1fr." For medium-sized screens, I modified it to have a single column with a width of "1fr." By implementing these adjustments, the "Our Services" section now adapts better to different screen sizes, improving its responsiveness.

Other issues that has been resolved:

- Lighthouse identified that the link labeled "Learn More" in the "About Us" section of the homepage did not have descriptive text. To address this issue, I replaced the generic phrase "Learn More" with the specific description "Know more about us." This modification enhances the SEO from a score of 90 to 100.
- Lighthouse verified that the iframe element within the map section does not have a title. To address this issue, I included a descriptive title for the frame to describe the map.

### Full Testing

To make sure my website works properly, I tested it on different web browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and also on different devices such as a Dell Inspiron 15-inch laptop and a Samsung A52S smartphone.

Additionally, I inspected each page using Google Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that they appeared correctly and were responsive on various screen sizes.

Links:

- I conducted link testing on the index page, about us page, services page, contact us page, and thank you page. During the testing, it was confirmed that all the links on these pages operated as expected. Additionally, any links that directed to external pages successfully opened in separate browser tabs.

Contact Us Form:

1. The contact us form was tested by submitting it without filling in any input fields. The form correctly prompted the user to fill in the First Name field. After filling in the first name and submitting the form, the form directed the user to fill out the Last Name field. Upon completing the last name and submitting the form, the user was prompted to fill in the Email field. Finally, after filling in the first name, last name and email, the form successfully submitted and opened the thank you page in the same browser window, considering the phone number and message fields as optional.
2. A test was performed by submitting the form with only the email address. The form correctly directed the user to fill in the First Name field. After providing the first name and email, the form prompted the user to fill out the Last Name field. Upon completing the first name, last name, and email, the form successfully submitted and opened the thank you page in the same browser window.
3. Another test was conducted by submitting the form with only the message field filled in. The form correctly directed the user to fill in the First Name field and then the Last Name field. After providing the first name, last name, and message, the form prompted the user to fill in the email field. Finally, after filling in the first name, last name, email, and message, the form successfully submitted and opened the thank you page in the same browser window.
