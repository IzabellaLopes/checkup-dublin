## Testing 

Testing was conducted consistently throughout the website development process to ensure its functionality. Chrome developer tools were utilized to identify and troubleshoot any issues that arose during the build.

During the mid-project meeting with my mentor, we discussed and addressed specific issues that were identified:

- The responsive design of the landing page image for small screen sizes (650px wide and below) had an issue where the right border of the cover text would disappear from the screen. However, this problem was successfully resolved after my mentor suggested including a percentage-based property (1%) for the class "cover-text" and it worked perfectly.
- The testimonials section had an issue with its responsive design, where the image and text were overlapping in medium-sized screens. Initially, I had configured the code using the "float: left" property. However, my mentor suggested changing the CSS approach by using the "display: grid" property. Initially, the grid had four columns, but for medium-sized screens, it was changed to two columns, and for small-sized screens, it was changed to one column. This adjustment resolved the issue, and the responsive design now functions perfectly.
- The responsive design of the welcome section needed improvement as the welcome image was becoming smaller, and the text and image were positioned side by side in small screen sizes. To address this issue, I made the following changes: Replaced the initial code, which used "display: flex," with "display: grid" to achieve better results. Then, I modified the code by setting "grid-template-columns: 1fr" for screen sizes ranging from 900px wide and below. These adjustments were successful in achieving the desired outcome, improving the responsive design of the welcome section.
- A similar issue was promptly resolved in the "Our Team" images by changing the initial code from "display: flex" to "display: grid." This simple modification allowed me to configure the images initially with 4 columns and adjust them to 2 columns for larger to medium screen sizes in the responsive design. Additionally, for small screen sizes, the images were adjusted to display in a single column. This modification successfully addressed the issue and improved the responsive design of the "Our Team" section.
- To enhance the responsiveness of the "Our Services" section on the services page, I made the following changes: Instead of using "display: flex" with a flex-basis of 30% for the IDs "complete-checkup," "clinical-investigations," and "exams," I switched to "display: grid" with three template columns initially set as "1fr 1fr 1fr." For medium-sized screens, I modified it to have a single column with a width of "1fr." By implementing these adjustments, the "Our Services" section now adapts better to different screen sizes, improving its responsiveness.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
